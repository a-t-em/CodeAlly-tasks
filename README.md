'Binary converter': function that takes a binary number of any length as input and returns a denary number.

'Reduce to single digit': function that takes a number under 100 as input, multiplies the digits (updates the number with the product and loops if the product isn't less than 10), and ultimately returns a single digit. 
i.e. entering 47 will return 6 as 4x7=28 (loops), 2x8=16 (loops), and 1x6=6 (returns). 

'Order digits': function that takes a string of digits as input, and returns a string containing the same digits in descending order. 

'Find largest even/odd': function that takes a number in string format as input, and returns the largest two-digit even and odd number that can be formed from two adjacent digits in the string in array format with the even number first (e.g. '53449287983' returns ['98', '87']).
