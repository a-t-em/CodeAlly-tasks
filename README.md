Wrote a 'binary converter' function that takes a bineary number of any length as input and returns a denary number.

Wrote a 'reduce to single digit' function that takes a number under 100 as input, multiplies the digits (updates the number with the product and loops if the product isn't less than 10), and ultimatley returns a single digit. 
i.e. entering 47 will return 6 as 4x7=28 (loops), 2x8=16 (loops), and 1x6=6 (returns).
